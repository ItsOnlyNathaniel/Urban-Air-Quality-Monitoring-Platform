here’s a **step-by-step development plan** to build the **Urban Air Quality Monitoring Platform** over **6–8 weeks**. It's broken into logical **phases**, each with goals, deliverables, and tech tips to keep you focused and on schedule.

---

### 🧭 **WEEK 0: Project Setup & Planning (1–2 Days)**

#### ✅ Deliverables:

* Project repository on GitHub (monorepo or split frontend/backend)
* Basic README with project goals and high-level architecture
* AWS free-tier account and S3 bucket configured
* Domain name registered (e.g., via Route53)

#### 🔧 Tasks:

* Set up Dockerized development environment
* CI/CD with GitHub Actions for backend & frontend
* Setup pre-commit hooks (formatting, linting, etc.)

---

### 🗂️ **WEEK 1: Data Ingestion Pipeline + Database Setup**

#### ✅ Deliverables:

* ETL pipeline that fetches data from:

  * **Sentinel-5P (via Google Earth Engine or Copernicus APIs)**
  * **EPA AirNow or OpenAQ APIs**
* Data stored in **PostGIS**, with basic spatial tables and indexing

#### 🔧 Tasks:

* Write Celery tasks to run ETL jobs (daily/hourly)
* Transform raw satellite/ground data into standardized schema
* Create spatial indexes using `GIST` for performance
* Handle missing/null readings, coordinate normalization (WGS84)

---

### 🗺️ **WEEK 2: REST API + Backend Core**

#### ✅ Deliverables:

* FastAPI app with:

  * `/air-quality/` (GET, POST)
  * `/stations/`
  * `/predictions/`
* Swagger/OpenAPI auto-generated docs
* JWT-based authentication (OAuth2 optional)
* Rate limiting via FastAPI extensions or API Gateway (if needed)

#### 🔧 Tasks:

* Seed PostGIS with mock data to support API development
* Unit tests for each endpoint
* Load testing using Locust or Postman

---

### 🧠 **WEEK 3: Predictive Analytics + Task Automation**

#### ✅ Deliverables:

* Scikit-learn model:

  * Inputs: historical air quality + weather data
  * Output: AQI prediction for next 24–48 hours
* Periodic Celery job to retrain and predict
* Store predictions in DB with timestamp/location

#### 🔧 Tasks:

* Feature engineering (lag values, rolling averages)
* Use RandomForestRegressor or LinearRegression for simplicity
* Evaluate with RMSE/MAE and log results
* Train/test split per station or region

---

### 🌍 **WEEK 4: Geospatial Web Map**

#### ✅ Deliverables:

* React app with:

  * Map view using **MapLibre GL** or **Leaflet**
  * Time slider to scrub historical AQ data
  * Heatmap overlay (colored by AQI)
  * Clickable markers for stations

#### 🔧 Tasks:

* Connect map to backend via REST API
* Use Tailwind CSS for layout & styling
* Handle errors (missing data, offline tiles)
* Create reusable map components

---

### 📢 **WEEK 5: Alerts + Subscriptions**

#### ✅ Deliverables:

* Alerting system:

  * Users can subscribe to areas
  * Get email/SMS when AQI > threshold
* Use **Twilio/SendGrid** (or AWS SNS for SMS)

#### 🔧 Tasks:

* Background job to monitor thresholds
* Store subscriptions in DB (user\_id, location, threshold)
* Use Celery for alert dispatch
* Rate limit duplicate alerts per user/location

---

### 📊 **WEEK 6: Admin Dashboard + Monitoring**

#### ✅ Deliverables:

* React-based dashboard for:

  * API health
  * ETL job status (last success/failure)
  * Model prediction accuracy (RMSE/MAE)
  * Alert counts

#### 🔧 Tasks:

* Use Chart.js for time-series plots
* Add Prometheus/Grafana or simple logging for ETL health
* Admin-only endpoints in API

---

### 🚀 **WEEK 7: Deployment & Documentation**

#### ✅ Deliverables:

* Live app on AWS:

  * **EC2** for backend
  * **RDS (Postgres + PostGIS)**
  * **S3** for static hosting or asset storage
  * **Nginx** as reverse proxy
* DNS + SSL via Let’s Encrypt or AWS Certificate Manager

#### 🔧 Tasks:

* Deploy Dockerized app via docker-compose or ECS
* Write detailed README:

  * Architecture diagram
  * API reference
  * Setup instructions
* Swagger docs accessible at `/docs`
* Generate DB schema diagrams (use dbdiagram.io or pgAdmin export)

---

### 📣 **WEEK 8 (Optional): Polish + Outreach**

#### ✅ Deliverables:

* Blog post on dev.to or Medium:

  * Topic: "Optimizing Real-Time Geospatial Queries for Urban AQ Monitoring"
* Short demo video (Loom or YouTube)
* LinkedIn/Twitter post to showcase your project
* Prepare for technical questions (listed in original prompt)

---

### 💡 Optional Enhancements (Post-MVP):

* Mobile PWA support
* Support for multiple cities
* Live public dashboard
* Integration with AQ forecast APIs
* More advanced ML models (LSTM, XGBoost)

---
